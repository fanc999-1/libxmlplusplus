Building libxml++ with Visual Studio 2017 or later

* You will need Visual Studio 2017 (MSVC 15.7) or later, as C++-17 is required and only 15.7 or later had
  adequate C++-17 support
* Install libxml2 from https://xmlsoft.org/, either via Windows binaries or building from source.  It is
  strongly recommended, if building libxml2 from source, that Visual Studio 2015 or later is used
* Add libxml2 to the include and lib paths in Visual Studio.
* Run `nmake /f Makefile.vc CFG=[debug|release]` to buiild libxml++.  Run `nmake /f Makefile.vc` without the
  `CFG=[debug|release] flag to see which options are supported by the NMake Makefiles

* It is recommended that the dependent items is to be placed like the following, or be placed in paths
  indicated by %INCLUDE% and %LIB% respectively for the headers and .lib's:

<some_dir_1>\include
 |
 -libxml2 (and items in its subdir(s))
 |
 -(any dependent headers of libraries enabled by libxml2)

<some_dir_2>\lib
 |
 -libxml2.lib

  Fine-tune by passing in PREFIX=..., INCLUDEDIR=... (default:$(PREFIX)\include, example would be
  INCLUDEDIR=<some_dir_1>\include) and LIBDIR=... (default: $(PREFIX)\lib, example would be
  LIBDIR=<some_dir_2>\lib) as needed.
